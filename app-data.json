They are both component oriented, have automated changed detection and can render both on the server as well as on the client side. However, there are also quite a few differences in how they work and which philosophy they follow.</p><p>Based on advanced practical examples we will look at the most interesting differences between those two frameworks. This can help you understand your Angular 2 framework even better and gives you insights into what strengths and what weaknesses it has in certain scenarios.</p>",
